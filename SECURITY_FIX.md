# Security Fix - Removed Exposed Credentials

## Issue
Commit 8125230 exposed sensitive credentials including:
- PostgreSQL database URL with credentials
- OpenAI API key
- Google Places API key
- JWT secret

## Resolution
This commit removes the ENV_SETUP.md file that contained exposed credentials and ensures all sensitive information is properly secured.

## Actions Taken
1. Removed ENV_SETUP.md file that contained exposed credentials
2. Secured all .env files to use placeholder values
3. Added this security documentation

## Security Recommendations
- Rotate all exposed API keys immediately
- Change database credentials
- Generate new JWT secrets
- Never commit sensitive credentials to version control
